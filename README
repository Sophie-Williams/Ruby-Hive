I started this project because I like to grasp the game of Hive fully by iterating on good heuristics, improving them as I play against my own creation. A second goal of this project is to master the Ruby programming language, to master its style ,its cleanness in brevity and expressiveness. With the least amount of commenting I want to be able to pickup this project after a while of idleness and start where I left of immediately. Another important aspect of Ruby programming is unittesting. The hive board-game allows for a high degree of loose coupling and is therefore very unittestible.        

The project consists of two parts: 

-the game server interface

-the bot(s)      

At the time I am in the process of finalizing the framework part. There are some bugs which I am tracking down using unittesting. When the framework is correct I will begin with the heuristics of a Hive bot. At the time, for testing purposes, there is only one very basic bot which selects a move randomly from the entire set of allowed moves.
